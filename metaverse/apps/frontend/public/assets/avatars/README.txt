These avatars are rendered in-game using Phaser spritesheets.

Expected format:
- 32x48 frame size
- Same layout as the original /assets/image.png used by the game
- The game code assumes frames:
  - left walk: 0-3
  - idle: 4
  - right walk: 5-8

If you want fully custom characters, replace the PNGs below with real spritesheets
matching the layout above.
